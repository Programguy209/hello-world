# hello-world
Everybody has to start somewhere, it might as well be at the beginning.

BUT, sometimes the beginning is just no fun.  I find that beginning in the middle and working
my way back to the end, then jumping in the front of the middle of the beginning then I usually
just go back to the beginning because I'm really confused at this point.
